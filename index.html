            From the day we arrive on the planet<br>
            And blinking, step into the sun<br>
            There is more to see than can ever be seen<br>
            More to do than can ever be done<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There is far too much to take in here<br>
            More to find than can ever be found<br>
            But the sun rolling high<br>
            Through the sapphire sky<br>
            Keeps great and small on the endless round<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It's the Circle of Life<br>
            And it moves us all<br>
            Through despair and hope<br>
            Through faith and love<br>
            'Til we find our place<br>
            On the path unwinding<br>
            In the circle<br>
            The Circle of Life<br>
          </p>
